History of Mastermind/2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 8. Feb 1999: Version 1.3 is ready and uploaded to hobbes on 9. Feb 1999
              Have I been drunken while testing the second edition of v1.2?
              I introduced another bug with the "n-th try" button at every
              first try and didn't see it. Thanks to my girlfriend it was
              found quickly.
              Now I think we a have a button that hopefully works as supposed
              and that should be celebrated with an small step in the
              version :)

 5. Feb 1999: Sorry, due to incomplete testing the "n-th try"-button did not
              became a "start new game"-button after you finished playing. In
              all other cases (ok, there are not much) it worked well. This
              is fixed now, the version will remain 1.2 because no new
              features were added. Fixed version uploaded to hobbes on 8. Feb

 3. Feb 1999: Version 1.2 is ready and uploaded to hobbes
              (leo seems to have discarded it so future versions will only
              be found on hobbes)
              Changes are:
              * the button "n-th try" becomes a "start new game" button while
                no game is running (so you don't always have to access the
                menu)
              * updated the installation program: now it creates first the
                desktop-objects and then launches the user's guide
              * updated the user's guide

20. Jan 1999: Version 1.1 is ready and uploaded to hobbes and leo
              Changes are:
              * the "do you really want to exit" question is only
                asked if a game is running
              * your settings are saved and reloaded next time
                (there is currently only one setting: multiple colors)

 6. Jan 1999: Version 1.0 is ready and uploaded to hobbes and leo
              This is the first release of Mastermind/2
