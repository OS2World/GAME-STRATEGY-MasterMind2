How to translate Mastermind/2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a) copy the files mminden.rc and mminden.ipf to mmind??.rc and mmind??.ipf
   where ?? is a short code for the language (e.g. fr for french or de for
   deutsch [that's how german is called in german])

b) translate the files mmind??.rc and .ipf into your language. The files
   include some additional file-specific information.

c) create a file mmind??.nlv (that's for the install-program) with a simple
   text editor. The file must include in the first line the name of the
   language, the name of the user's guide in the second line and in the third
   line how you would call the readme-file in your language (the filename stays
   readme.txt, it's just for the label of the icon).
   The fourth line contains the word for "welcome" in your language that you
   used in the title of the welcome-page in mmind??.ipf, e.g. 'welcome' for the
   english version or 'willkommen' for german (where the title is "Willkommen
   bei Mastermind/2"). This is used to find the welcome-page for displaying it.

d) create a zip-archive containing these three files and send it to
   r.auberger@gmx.net with subject Mastermind/2


Additional information:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As an example there are the files for english and german included. If you
are unsure you may want to take a look into these files first before contacting
the author.
Life is much easier with keywordhighlighting. I included the neccessary files
for epm in this archive. Just copy them into x:\os2\apps where x: is your boot
drive.
