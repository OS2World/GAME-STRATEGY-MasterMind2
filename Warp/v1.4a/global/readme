0. Requirements
*******************************
This version of Mastermind/2 needs OS/2 Warp 3, Warp 4 or higher to run.
Since I have no machine running OS/2 2.x there is no support for this platform
at the moment. The latest version for OS/2 2.x is Mastermind/2 v1.3 which is
available from http://www.geocites.com/SiliconValley/Port/4718/v14/mmind132.zip

There are no special hardware requirements. Each system that runs OS/2 should
be enough for Mastermind/2. This is because Mastermind/2 uses very little
memory and the program itself is small, too.



*******************************
1.1 Update from previous version
*******************************
a) If you already have a previous version of Mastermind/2 you should delete
   it's folder. This is necessary because it forces the install-program to
   create all the MasterMind/2 icons again. The various MasterMind/2 icons
   need to be recreated due to the renaming of the file that the users guide
   icon points to, as well as allowing correction for the language differences
   between the icon names in the MasterMind/2 versions.
b) Unzip the downloaded files into the existing directory and let unzip
   overwrite everything it wants to.
c) Run the install-program. If you have questions about the install-program
   please take a look at "1.2 Installation" below.
d) It's safe to delete mmind.hlp from your previous version, because it has
   been renamed.



*******************************
1.2 Installation
*******************************
a) Download the base and at least one language package. You may download more
   than one language package if you like. (Note: the base package from hobbes
   has the English language package already included).
b) Unzip all archives in an empty directory. There is nothing special you must
   take care of, just unzip. The directory will be the final directory where
   Mastermind/2 will stay after installation.
c) Run the command-file install.cmd. Select one of the shown languages.
   This program will create a Mastermind/2 folder icon on your desktop.
   You are advised to move it into the folder "Programs / Games". The
   installation program will not automatically move the Mastermind/2 folder
   into the Programs\Games area due to the language differences in the various
   OS/2 releases.
   After that the user's guide is launched.

Note: One or more Mastermind/2 language versions can be installed at the same
   time. The language you choose during installation is only relevent to the
   users guide icon and does not influence the game itself!
   During the game you can switch between all installed languages. To install
   another language just download the language package and unzip it into the
   same directory as Mastermind/2.

2. License
*******************************
This program is postcardware. That means: if you like it and play it you are
required to send a picture postcard to the author. This will inform me of how
many people use it and if it is worth to do some future versions  - which may
contain sounds, real-time 3D animations, support of force-feedback joysticks
etc :-)

And it will show me if there are some OS/2ers out there who play games :-)
Perhaps it will also drive me to develop some more programs (for OS/2 of
course). You may distribute this program freely and are not allowed to charge
for it (except the costs you have for distribution). You are welcome to put it
on CD-ROM collections etc after contacting the author. To get your free
license write to (include your e-mail address if you want to be notified of
future versions):

If you want to use e-mail instead (not for registering please, I like picture
postcards from all over the world): r.auberger@gmx.net, subject: Mastermind/2.

3. Known Bugs
*******************************
At the moment there are NO serious bugs known!
In some rare cases, dropping a colored pin will result in a pin being displayed
that is not entirely drawn. But this seems to be a bug in "animated mouse
pointers" which I am using. Just force the affected pin to be redrawn (e.g by
moving something over the window or moving the window out of the screen or
pausing & unpausing the game or or or...).
Bugreports (and correction of my english - I am not a native speaker) are
welcome. Please write to r.auberger@gmx.net, subject: Mastermind/2.
