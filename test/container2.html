<H2>Where were we?</H2>

Last month I briefly introduced (in that oh-so-poor writing style that
makes me unique) the container control and some of the programming basics
that everyone should know.  This month, we will continue this trek into the
unknown by describing the tree view as well as some other nifty things.
Also, we will write our first application using the container, on which we
will build in next month's installment.

<H3>From Another Viewpoint</H3>

<P>As a quick note, the name and text views were omitted last month because
they are - from a programmer's perspective - identical to the icon view.

<H2>The Wood Nymph's Delight</H2>

<P>The tree view should be a highly familiar one; it parallels nicely with the
directory structure of a hard disk and has been used in the File Manager
(from OS/2 1.x) and the Help Manager as well as many other applications.
It also has three subviews that can be specified in the CM_SETCNRINFO
message:  tree icon view, tree name view, and tree text view (these are
specified by "or-ing" the CV_ICON, CV_NAME, or CV_TEXT flags with the
CV_TREE flag in the flWindowAttr field, respectively).  The difference
between these views is in the way the data is represented:  icon view
displays an icon with the text to the right and to the left is a separate
bitmap indicating whether the item is expanded or collapsed (if
applicable); name view is the same as icon view except that the
expanded/collapsed indicator is indicated in the icon; the text view
provides only the text string with the expanded/collapsed indicator as a
separate bitmap to the left.

<P>Note the difference between icon and name view.  Remember when, in the
beginning of the series, it was mentioned that there are a few differences
between using the MINIRECORDCORE and RECORDCORE structure?  This is one of
those differences; since only the RECORDCORE structure has different fields
for the expanded and collapsed icons, the name view cannot be used with the
CCS_MINIRECORDCORE style.

<P>When inserting records into the container, the parent record is specified
in the pRecordParent field of the RECORDINSERT structure.  In the icon
view, we specified this as NULL, since there is not parent/child
relationships in that view.  However, in the tree views, this is
particularly important because it specifies how the records are to be
displayed.  All records that have children will be displayed by adding an
expanded/collapsed indicator to its left.  If, by some action of the user,
you switch to any other non-tree view, all but the top-level records are
hidden.

<H3>Notifications</H3>

<P>In addition to the "normal" notifications, the container provides 2
notifications specific to the tree view:
<dl>
<dt><B>CN_COLLAPSETREE</B></dt>
<dd>This is sent to the owner after the container collapses a
subtree. mpParm2 points to the record that was collapsed.</dd>
<dt><B>CN_EXPANDTREE</B></dt>
<dd>This is sent to the owner after the container expands a
subtree. mpParm2 points to the record that was expanded.</dd>
</dl>

<H2>CNR2 - A Sample Application</H2>

<P>Now let us delve into the depths of our first sample application; it not
only showcases the container control, but it also contains some nifty
tricks that I think you'll find useful.  The structure is that of a
"typical" PM application and it should not be new to you.  In the code, I
have placed several "landmarks"; these are marked by placing a comment of
the form "@n" (where `n' is the landmark number) starting at column 55.
These landmarks are used to point out things of interest and are discussed
in more detail later.

<P>The application does nothing more than add a record for each month of each
year for the number of years specified in NUM_YEARS.  This is to show how
the tree view is used.  A popup menu is displayed whenever the system
key/mouse sequence is pressed, allowing to you switch between icon and tree
views, etc.

<H3>Landmark 1</H3>

<P>This is simply to point out the typedefs used.
<pre>
typedef struct _CLIENTDATA {                          // @1
   USHORT usSzStruct;         // Size of the structure
   HAB habAnchor;             // Anchor block of the window
   HWND hwndFrame;            // Frame of the client (== parent)
   HWND hwndCnr;              // Container window
   HPOINTER hptrYear;         // Icon for the year records
   HPOINTER hptrMonth;        // Icon for the month records
   HWND hwndWndMenu;          // Menu window
} CLIENTDATA, *PCLIENTDATA;

typedef struct _MYCNRREC {
   MINIRECORDCORE mrcCore;    // Base structure
   CHAR achText[64];          // Icon text
} MYCNRREC, *PMYCNRREC;

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PFNSRCH is used by searchCnr().  The parameters are:  container window
// handle, record pointer, and user-data pointer, respectively.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
typedef BOOL (*PFNSRCH)(HWND,PVOID,PVOID);
</pre>

<P>CLIENTDATA is the instance data for the client window.  Granted, we could
have used global variables, but that is poor programming practice so we
avoid doing this (the only global we use is an constant array of pointers
to the names of the months).

<P>MYCNRREC is the definition for the container records.  Note that we are
using the MINIRECORDCORE structure.

<P>PFNSRCH is a pointer to a function accepting three parameters and returning
a boolean.  It is used in a very interesting way that you'll see later.

<H3>Landmark 2</H3>

<P>This is only to point out that while it is highly recommended that you
allocate and insert as many records as possible each time sometimes it
simply isn't possible.  We have to allocate/insert each year separately
followed by the twelve months.

<H3>Landmark 3</H3>

<P>Since we specified FALSE in the fInvalidateRecord field of the RECORDINSERT
structure, we have to send a CM_INVALIDATERECORD message to update the
container.

<H3>Landmark 4</H3>

<P>This entire procedure is useful, since (as described in a previous issue of
the magazine) you cannot specify MIS_CONDITIONALCASCADE in a resource file.
It should also be noted that since the cascade button takes up a bit more
space, it is helpful to add a few blank spaces in the menu template to
account for this.  As a general rule, I use three blanks.

<H3>Landmark 5</H3>

<P>Here is another useful procedure; it performs a recursive, post-traversal
search of the container, calling a user-specified procedure at each record
to see if it matches the criteria also specified by the caller.  If you've
ever wondered what a use for reserved parameter is, here is one.  We use
the reserved parameter to specify the record we are currently checking; by
having the user specify NULL, we can check to see if this is the initial
call.

<P>Of course, we could have eliminated the reserved parameter and had this
procedure call another procedure with a reserved parameter to remove the
burden from the caller, but that's too easy.  (* grin *)

<H3>Landmark 6</H3>

<P>This is to point out the allocation and initialization of the client
instance data.  Note that the cleanup is done in the WM_DESTROY processing.

<H3>Landmark 7</H3>

<P>This is to show a bug in the container - if the user uses the mouse to
invoke the popup menu, the container sends us a WM_CONTROL message. Not so
if the user uses the keyboard, thus we duplicate the code and check for the
WM_CONTEXTMENU message.

<H3>Landmark 8</H3>

<P>Finally, we invoke the searchCnr() function specifying a pointer to a
boolean that contains the desired select state.  The searchSelect()
function is an interesting one.
<pre>
BOOL searchSelect(HWND hwndCnr,PMYCNRREC pmcrRecord,PBOOL pbSelect)
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This function is used to select/deselect all records.  Note that it
// always returns FALSE, so that searchCnr() will traverse the entire
// record list.
//
// Input:  hwndCnr - handle of the container window
//         pmcrRecord - pointer to the container record
//         pbSelect - pointer to a BOOL specifying whether to select the
//                    record or not
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
{
   WinSendMsg(hwndCnr,
              CM_SETRECORDEMPHASIS,
              MPFROMP(pmcrRecord),
              MPFROM2SHORT(*pbSelect,CRA_SELECTED));
   return FALSE;
}
</pre>

<P>See how it simply sets the record's select state and always returns FALSE -
indicating that this record does not match - forcing searchCnr() to
traverse the entire container.

<H3>That's It!</H3>

<P>That is all there is to it!  Note that while there is a lot of setup
involved, the container is no more difficult to use than any of the other
"standard" controls.

<H2>Summary</H2>

<P>We have seen how tree views can be used for hierarchical structures and how
they are not much different that the icon, name, and text views described
last month.  We have used these concepts and introduced new ones in a
sample application which will be used as a scaffold to add new features in
future installments of this series.

<P>Next month we will describe the details view, selection states, direct
editing, and possibly other ideas and will incorporate these concepts into
our sample application.
