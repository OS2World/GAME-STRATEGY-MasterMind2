<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The release of OS/2 2.0 was special in many ways; not the least was the
inclusion of four new standard PM controls:  the container, the notebook,
the slider, and the value set.  Without question, the most difficult of
these to utilize fully is the container control.  Its flexible design
allowed for it to be used in a variety of fashions (which is no surprise
when you look at its real-world counterpart) and provided a CUA 91
compliant interface without much additional work by the programmer.
Unfortunately, the initial work that has to be done is significant and has
daunted many developers.

<P>This article begins a multi-part series on how to program the container and
will describe the container control from a developer's perspective as well
as introduce some of the basic programming concepts that can be used in you
applications.  For additional information, it is highly recommended that
you acquire a copy of the Winter and Spring 1993 issues of the OS/2
Developer magazine (produced by IBM Corp. and published by Miller Freeman
Inc.).  These two issues contain a single article each by the container
control developers on how to use it and are both very informative.

<P><H2>A Bird's-Eye View</H2>

<P>In "real-life" a container is something that you see everyday. Most people
store foodstuffs in Tupperware containers.  On many office desks, pens and
pencils are stored in containers.  In a filing cabinet, documents are
stored in another container, although it is more widely known as a folder.
Everywhere you look, there are containers being used; because of this, the
CUA designers decided that the ability to store objects in a container was
a very good thing; not only was it a familiar concept, but it was also
already being used on another computer platform (the MacIntosh) with
extremely good results.

<P>The container is exactly what you think it is.  It allows an application to
place "things" inside of it and these things can be viewed in one of five
different ways.  The term "thing" is used because the container does not
restrict the application in the type of items stored.  The five different
views supported by the container are listed below:

<P><TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=5>
<TR><TD><B>View</B></TD> <TD><B>Description</B></TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD>Icon</TD>
     <TD>Each object is represented as an icon with a descriptive string
         below it.</TD>
</TR>
<TR> <TD>Name</TD>
     <TD>Each object is represented as an icon with a descriptive string to
         the right.</TD>
</TR>
<TR> <TD>Text</TD>
     <TD>Each object is represented solely as a descriptive string.</TD>
</TR>
<TR> <TD>Tree</TD>
     <TD>Each object is represented as a hierarchical diagram of icons and/or
         descriptive strings.</TD>
</TR>
<TR> <TD>Detail</TD>
     <TD>Each object is represented as a detailed description of the
         object. The information displayed is defined by the application.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>This month, we will only employ the icon view for simplicity.  The other
views will be covered in subsequent months.

<P>Each object is described to the container using a base data type - this can
be either the RECORDCORE or the MINIRECORDCORE structure, depending on the
CCS_ style used when creating the control. (For the purposes of our
discussion, the MINIRECORDCORE structure will be referenced although either
could be used.)  When objects are allocated, additional memory at the end
of the MINIRECORDCORE structure can be requested, for the storage of any
object-specific data. Thus, you would have to define a structure to contain
both the base data and the additional fields needed:

<P><PRE><SMALL>
typedef struct _MYCNRREC {
   MINIRECORDCORE mrcCore;
   CHAR achText[256];
   ULONG ulNumSold;
   float fGrossIncome;
   float fNetIncome;
   float fTotalCost;
   float fNetProfit;
} MYCNRREC, *PMYCNRREC;
</SMALL></PRE>

<P>Since the container, when returning pointers to the object records, always
returns a PRECORDCORE type, you will need to typecast this to your
application-defined type (here, PMYCNRREC).

<P><H2>Basic Record Operations</H2>

<P><H3>Inserting and Removing Records</H3>

<P>The container makes a distinction between allocation and insertion of
records; likewise, a similar distinction is made between removing a record
and freeing the memory consumed by the record.  Allocation is accomplished
by sending the control a CM_ALLOCRECORD message, while insertion is done by
sending a CM_INSERTRECORD message.

<P>The CM_ALLOCRECORD requires the number of additional bytes needed in
mpParm1 and the number of records to allocate in mpParm2.  If more than one
record is allocated, a linked list of the records is returned (with the
linked being the preccNextRecord field in the MINIRECORDCORE structure);
otherwise, a pointer to the record is returned.  The container will
initialize the entire structure to "nothing" (meaning no icon, no text,
etc.).  It is your responsibility to "fill-in-the-blanks" so that something
meaningful will appear in the control; for the icon view, these fields are
the hptrIcon and pszIcon fields of the MINIRECORDCORE structure.  You
should set them to the handle of the icon and to the pointer to the
descriptive text to be displayed, respectively.  Using our MYCNRREC
structure again as an example:

<P><PRE><SMALL>
ULONG ulExtra;
PMYCNRREC pmcrRecord;

ulExtra=sizeof(MYCNRREC)-sizeof(MINIRECORDCORE);

pmcrRecord=(PMYCNRREC)PVOIDFROMMR
                   (WinSendMsg(hwndCnr,
                               CM_ALLOCRECORD,
                               MPFROMLONG(ulExtra),
                               MPFROMSHORT(1)));
if (pmcrRecord!=NULL) {
   pmcrRecord->mrcCore.hptrIcon=
      WinLoadPointer(HWND_DESKTOP,
                     NULLHANDLE,
                     HPTR_PRODUCT);
   pmcrRecord->mcrCore.pszIcon=pmcrRecord->achText;
   strcpy(pmcrRecord->achText,"Thing-A-Ma-Jig");
} /* endif */
</SMALL></PRE>

<P>Once you have allocated, initialized, and are ready to insert your records,
you need to describe the placement of the records to the container (via the
RECORDINSERT structure) to the container.  An item of interest is that the
container has two notions of order:  z-order and item-order. The former
should be familiar because PM windows all have this concept.  The latter,
however, is useful when you wish to enumerate the records in an order other
than the z-order placement without affecting the appearance of the records
in the container.  Continuing our example above:

<P><PRE><SMALL>
RECORDINSERT riInsert;

riInsert.cb=sizeof(RECORDINSERT);
riInsert.pRecordOrder=CMA_FIRST;
   /* Insert at the head of the list */
riInsert.pRecordParent=NULL;
   /* No parent record */
riInsert.fInvalidateRecord=TRUE;
   /* Automatic invalidation of records */
riInsert.zOrder=CMA_TOP;
   /* Place on top of siblings */
riInsert.cRecordsInsert=1;

WinSendMsg(hwndCnr,
           CM_INSERTRECORD,
           MPFROMP(pmcrRecord),
           MPFROMP(&amp;riInsert));
</SMALL></PRE>

<P>A couple of important things should be noted here:

<P><UL>
<LI>It is very inefficient to allocate and insert records one at a time.  If
at all possible, allocate many records and insert them all at once.

<P><LI>You can specify FALSE for the fInvalidateRecord field to cause the
container not to invalidate the records once they are inserted.  Doing this
allows you to reflow - or arrange - the records in the container before
displaying them ( using the CM_ARRANGE) message.  If you choose to do this,
you must send a CM_INVALIDATERECORD message specifying CMA_REPOSITION and
CMA_ERASE to redraw the container.
</UL>

<P>To remove a record from the list, you use the CM_REMOVERECORD message.  If
you choose not to have the container free the memory (using the CMA_FREE
flag), you must also send a CM_FREERECORD message to return the memory to
the system.  A "gotcha" here is that the first parameter of the two
messages is a pointer to an array of pointers. Thus, if you are only
removing one record, you need to specify a pointer to the record pointer:

<P><PRE><SMALL>
PMYCNRREC pmcrRecord;

/* Query the first record in the container */
pmcrRecord=(PMYCNRREC)PVOIDFROMMR(
                WinSendMsg(hwndCnr,
                           CM_QUERYRECORD,
                           MPFROMP(NULL),
                           MPFROM2SHORT(CMA_FIRST,
                           CMA_ITEMORDER)));

/* Remove it and free the memory */
WinSendMsg(hwndCnr,
           CM_REMOVERECORD,
           MPFROMP(&amp;pmcrRecord),
           MPFROMSHORT(CMA_FREE));

/* We now need to invalidate the container */
WinSendMsg(hwndCnr,
           CM_INVALIDATERECORD,
           MPFROMP(NULL),
           MPFROM2SHORT(0,CMA_REPOSITION|
                        CMA_ERASE));
</SMALL></PRE>

<P><H3>Arranging the Records</H3>

<P>Arranging the records is as simple as sending a CM_ARRANGE message.  This
message takes no parameters. the record pointer:

<P><PRE><SMALL>
WinSendMsg(hwndCnr,
           CM_ARRANGE,
           0,
           0);
</SMALL></PRE>

<P><H2>Using the CM_SETCNRINFO Message</H2>

<P>To change the value any of a multitude of attributes belonging to the
container, you can use the CM_SETCNRINFO message.  This controls everything
about the container including the current view type, which is probably its
most widely used feature.  The way this message works is that you define a
variable of type CNRINFO, set the appropriate fields, and send the message.
In the second parameter, you specify one or more flags which tells the
container which fields to examine.  Thus, you do not have to initialize the
entire structure for one field. the record pointer:

<P><PRE><SMALL>
CNRINFO ciInfo;

/* Change the view to icon view */
ciInfo.flWindowAttr=CV_ICON;

WinSendMsg(hwndCnr,
           CM_SETCNRINFO,
           MPFROMP(&amp;ciInfo),
           MPFROMLONG(CMA_FLWINDOWATTR));
</SMALL></PRE>

<P>This provides a very limited example of the CM_SETCNRINFO message.  For
more information about the CNRINFO structure see the Technical Reference,
available with the Programming Toolkit.

<P><H2>Basic Notifications</H2>

<P>The container will notify its owner via the WM_CONTROL message whenever any
of a multitude of events occur.  Five of the more basic notifications are
listed:

<P><TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=5>
<TR> <TD><B>Code</B></TD> <TD><B>Meaning</B></TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD>CN_ENTER</TD>
     <TD>The user pressed ENTER or double clicked the mouse while the
         container had the focus.</TD>
</TR>
<TR> <TD>CN_HELP</TD>
     <TD>The user pressed F1 while the container had the focus.</TD>
</TR>
<TR> <TD>CN_CONTEXTMENU</TD>
     <TD>The user pressed the context menu key combination as
         defined on the System settings.  The default for the system is
         Ctrl+F10.</TD>
</TR>
<TR> <TD>CN_SETFOCUS</TD>
     <TD>The container has received the focus.</TD>
</TR>
<TR> <TD>CN_KILLFOCUS</TD>
     <TD>The container is losing the focus.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Next month we'll briefly describe a few others and their meanings.

<P><H2>Next Month</H2>

<P>Next month, we will look at the tree view as well as look at a few other
notifications.  Also, we will build our first sample application using the
concepts described here and in next month's article.

<P><H2>Example Container Object Record</H2>

<P>Used as the object record type throughout this article, the definition is
below:

<P><PRE><SMALL>
typedef struct _MYCNRREC {
   MINIRECORDCORE mrcCore;
   CHAR achText[256];
   ULONG ulNumSold;
   float fGrossIncome;
   float fNetIncome;
   float fTotalCost;
   float fNetProfit;
} MYCNRREC, *PMYCNRREC;
</SMALL></PRE>
