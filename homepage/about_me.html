<h4>Let me introduce myself:</h4>
<p>My name is Ren&eacute; Auberger and I am living in southern germany in a city called <a href="http://www.boeblingen.de/" target="_top">B&ouml;blingen</a> (about
48.000 inhabitants). If you don't have a big german map you will probably not be able to find it. The next bigger
city is <a href="http://www.stuttgart.de/" target="_top">Stuttgart</a>, 20km in the north of B&ouml;blingen. I now don't
tell you how old I am, because if I do this, I have to update this page too often :-) But you can get the month I was born
in, this shouldn't change too frequently: it was December 1975.</p>

<h4>What I am doing:</h4>
<p>I was born in the middle of germany and moved into the south after I finished school and got the ability to study Information
Technology in Stuttgart. My studies ended in October 1998 with my diploma (for computer scientists only: the title is
"Design, implementation and feasibility study of a Lotus Domino intranet-server on IBM S/390"). Now I am working as an 
instructor for Information Technology students in the vocational department of an international company in the computer
industry.</p>

<h4>My "OS/2-evolution" and other projects I'm working on:</h4>
<p>I am using OS/2 since version 2.1 and didn't miss a release :-) So my state today is Warp 4 with Fixpack 12 in german.
Mastermind/2 was the first program I released to the public, but currently I am working with some other guys from around the
world on project "<a href="http://members.xoom.com/Virusface/" target="_top">everblue</a>". The goal of project everblue is to port Xlib to OS/2's Presentation Manager (PM), which would
enable the OS/2 community to recompile nearly every program written for the X Window system, link it against our library and run it
under OS/2 natively.</p>
